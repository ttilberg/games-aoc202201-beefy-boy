* 3.23
** [Pro] [VR] Headset and controller orientation added.
   A normalized vector with ~x,y,z~ is returned for all orientations.
   - ~args.inputs.controller_one.left_hand.orientation.(x|y|z)
   - ~args.inputs.controller_one.right_hand.orientation.(x|y|z)
   - ~args.inputs.headset.orientation.(x|y|z)
** [Pro] Texture atlases explicitly search for a single directory to avoid long startup times.
   The default directory that will be searched is =sprites=. You can override the default
   directory by specifying ~sprites_directory=DIRECTORY~ in =game_metadata.txt=.
** [Support] Line and border rendering is 140%+ faster for ~Hash~ and ~Class~ based representations.
** =cvars.txt= added with HTTP logging disabled.
   =./mygame/metadata/cvars.txt= has been added to the zip file with the following contents:
   #+begin_src cvars
   log.filter_subsystems=HTTPServer
   #+end_src
** [Support] ~Numeric#vector~ has been deprecated.
   Use ~Numeric.to_vector~ which returns a ~Hash~ containing ~x~ and ~y~ instead of ~Array/Tuple~.

   Location: =./samples/02_input_basics/07_managing_scenes/=
* 3.21
** [Pro] [Support] Added portrait mode.
   In =metadata/game_metadata.txt= you can specify ~orientation=portrait~ to build a game that has
   a logical canvas of 720x1280 (as opposed to ~landscape~ 1280x720).
** [Pro] [iOS] ~$wizards.ios.start~ creates the correct metadata file for portrait mode games.
** [Pro] [Support] All Screen renders/scales correctly even if the window is smaller than 720p.
** [Pro] [Support] ~args.layout.rect~ expanded to support Portrait mode (and simplified).

* 3.19
** [Pro] Updates to DragonRuby Game Toolkit Pro.
   The following updates have been made to the Pro license.
*** [Support] HD rendering capabilities added.
    HD rendering capabilities have been added for the Pro version of DragonRuby Game Toolkit.
    Detailed documentation can be found inside of =./metadata/game_metadata.txt= and in the sample apps.

    Check out the following YouTube Video for a demo of All Screen Mode: [[https://youtu.be/Rnc6z84zaa4]]

    Check out the following YouTube Video for a demo of Texture Atlases: [[https://youtu.be/gH0XiafWQ_c]]

    Clepto Frog and The Little Probe both have HD Configurations that can be enabled. Be sure to play
    around with them.
**** Rending support for 720p to 5K.
     A sample app that shows HD Rendering can be found at =./samples/07_advanced_rendering_hd/01_hd_labels=

     To enable HD Mode set ~hd=true~ inside of =./metadata/game_metadata.txt=. Your game will
     be scaled to best fit the screen size that it's being run on (labels inside of render targets
     are also rendered at native scale).
**** Texture Atlases.
     A sample app that shows how texture atlases work can be found at =./samples/07_advanced_rendering_hd/02_texture_atlases=

     With HD mode enabled. DragonRuby will automatically use HD sprites given the following
     naming convention (assume we are using a sprite called =player.png=):

     | Name  | Resolution | File Naming Convention (enum) |
     |-------+------------+-------------------------------|
     | 720p  |   1280x720 | =player.png=                  |
     | HD+   |   1600x900 | =player@125.png=              |
     | 1080p |  1920x1080 | =player@125.png=              |
     | 1440p |  2560x1440 | =player@200.png=              |
     | 1800p |  3200x1800 | =player@250.png=              |
     | 4k    |  3200x2160 | =player@300.png=              |
     | 5k    |  6400x2880 | =player@400.png=              |

     The current file naming convention DR is trying to use can be accessed
     via ~args.grid.render_scale_enum~ (be sure to take a look at the sample app).
**** All Screen Mode.
     To enable All Screen Mode set ~allscreen=true~ inside of =./metadata/game_metadata.txt=. All
     Screen Mode removes letter boxing around your game allowing you to render outside of the
     1280x720 logical area (unsafe screen area).

     You can also set ~allscreen_max_scale=RENDER_SCALE_ENUM~ which controls how your games scales
     past 720p (giving you more or less unsafe screen area).

     The following properties on ~args.grid~ can assist in rendering off-screen:

     - ~allscreen_left~
     - ~allscreen_right~
     - ~allscreen_width~
     - ~allscreen_height~
     - ~allscreen_width~
     - ~allscreen_height~
     - ~allscreen_offset_x~
     - ~allscreen_offset_y~
     - ~render_width~
     - ~render_height~

     NOTE: All ~allscreen~ values above are given in the logical 1280x720 scale (you will still continue
     to render your game assuming 1280x720).
*** [Pro] [Support] [VR] Simulator, Device Tracking, Z-Depth Buffering
    Some much needed apis have been added to DragonRuby Game Toolkit VR.
**** Z-Depth Buffering
     Sprites are automatically sorted based off of their ~z~ property (you no
     longer have to manually sort primitives within your game). If you see visual
     tearing, it means that two primitives are competing for the same Z depth
     and one has to be moved forward or back.

     Note: Z-depth buffering assumes that your primitives are not transparent. If
     you are using transparent sprites, you must sort by Z values for cascading
     transparencies to render _mostly_ correctly. This is a fundamental limitation
     of OpenGL. You can read more about this limitation at [[https://www.sjbaker.org/steve/omniv/alpha_sorting.html]].
**** Headset and controller tracking added.
     The following device locations are now available.

     - ~args.inputs.headset.position.(x|y|z)~
     - ~args.inputs.controller_one.left_hand.position.(x|y|z)~
     - ~args.inputs.controller_one.right_hand.position.(x|y|z)~

     Things to note about the values above:

     - All location values are floating point numbers representing the relative distance from the
       Boundary's Origin.
     - The floating point values represent the number of meters away from that origin position.
     - 96 pixels maps to 1 meter in VR.
     - DR's VR world is 1280x1280x1280 (try the VR Skybox sample app to see what that scale looks like).
**** VR Simulator
     You can see how your game looks like in VR using ~./dragonruby-vrsim~ (start up that process as opposed
     to ~./dragonruby~).

     Controls:

     - You can use a USB controller to simulate the buttons on the Oculus Quest controllers.
     - Pressing =ctrl+m= will capture mouse and keyboard input. Use =WASD/arrow= keys to move
       around the VR environment. Mouse to look around. and =I= and =K= to fly up and down in the
       VR environment.
     - Press =ctrl+g= to exit mouse capture.

     Note: There's still a bit of work that needs to be done with the simulator. Hope you find what's
     currently there useful.
*** [Support] [iOS] Remote hotloading on iOS devices logs to ~spam~ category instead of ~debug~.
** [Pro] [Indie] [Standard] Updates to all license tiers.
   The following updates are available at all licensing tiers.
*** [Support] Added ~$gtk.set_mouse_grab(true/false)~.
*** [Support] Added ~$gtk.list_files(dir)~, ~$gtk.stat_file(path)~, and ~$gtk.delete_file(path)~.
    You can view documentation for file apis:
    - Under =./docs/docs.txt
    - At [[http://docs.dragonruby.org]] (latest version).
    - Or at [[http://localhost:9001]] while your game is running.
*** [Support] ~log_(spam|debug|info|warn|error|unfiltered)~ functions added to ~Object~.
    The logging apis that were only available via ~$gtk~ are now accessible at the top level.
*** [Support] Performance enhancements to ~GTK::Geometry::intersect_rect?(rect_1, rect_2, tolerance)~
    The ~intersect_rect?~ api has been re-implemented in C which significantly increases performance.
*** [Support] Added ~GTK::Geometry::find_intersect_rect(rect, rects, tolerance)~
    A helper method called ~find_intersect_rect~ has been added.

    If you find yourself doing:
    #+begin_src ruby
      collision = args.state.enemies.find { |e| e.intersect_rect? args.state.player }
    #+end_src

    You can instead do the following for a significant performance boost:
    #+begin_src ruby
      collision = args.geometry.find_intersect_rect(args.state.enemies, args.state.player)
    #+end_src
*** [Samples] Added sample app that shows how to wrap long lines of text.

** [OSS] Small styling changes have been made to the Console.
** [Support] Added documentation for ~args.gtk.(mouse|keyboard)_focus~.
** [Support] Added documentation for ~args.gtk.platform?~.
** [Support] Added ~repl_silent~ which suppresses showing the Console (usable in =app/repl.rb=)
   The following when added to =app/repl.rb= will bring up the Console after execution:

** [Support] Matrix math apis moved to ~Matrix~ class/module.
   Instead of ~vec3(1, 1, 1)~, you will need to do ~Matrix.vec3(1, 1, 1)~.

   Optionally you can mixin the ~MatrixFunctions~ module into your class to remove the ~Matrix~
   prefix requirement.

   VR and Advanced Rendering sample apps have been updated to reflect this change.

   Option 1:
   #+begin_src ruby
     def tick args
       puts Matrix.vec4(1, 1, 1, 1)
     end
   #+end_src

   Option 2:

   - 3D matrix transforms: =./samples/07_advanced_rendering/15_matrix_and_triangles_3d=
   - 3D matrix transforms advanced: (with mouse look): =./samples/07_advanced_rendering/15_matrix_cubeworld=
** [Standard] [Support] Hash-based sprite rendering is a tiny bit faster.
** [Standard] The following matrix math apis have been added to ~Object~ (accessible from anywhere):
   The intent of these matrix functions is to mirror GLSL matrix apis.
   - ~vec(2|3|4)~: Creates a ~vec~ with the given dimension. Represented as a ~Hash~
                   with the ~primitive_marker~ set to ~:vec2~, ~:vec3~, or ~vec4~.
   - ~mat(2|3|4)~: Creates a ~mat~ with the given dimension. Represented as a ~Hash~ of ~Hash~es
                   with the ~primitive_marker~ set to ~:mat2~, ~:mat3~, ~:mat4~ at the top level,
                   and ~:vec(2|3|4)~ for each vector component.
   - ~add~: Adds matrices given to the function (returns ~nil~ if a matrix multiplication isn't valid).
   - ~mul~: Multiplies matrices given to the function. Returns ~nil~ if the matrices are incompatible.
   - ~dot~: Performs a scalar dot product for matrices given a list of matrices. Returns ~nil~ if the matrices are incompatible.
   - ~cross~: Performs a cross product for matrices given a list of matrices. Returns ~nil~ if the matrices are incompatible.
   - ~normalize~: Normalizes a vector. Returns the new normalized vector as a new ~Hash~.
   - ~normalize!~: Normalizes a vector. Mutates the vector passed in.
   - ~distance~: Returns the distance between to vectors. Returns ~nil~ if the vectors are incompatible.
   - ~Hash#+~: Delegates to ~add~ for matrix multiplication. Returns ~nil~ if the matrices are
               incompatible or if ~primitive_marker~ isn't set on the ~Hash~.
   - ~Hash#*~: Delegates to ~mul~ for matrix multiplication. Returns ~nil~ if the matrices are
               incompatible or if ~primitive_marker~ isn't set on the ~Hash~.
** [Standard] Added ~Numeric#from_(bottom|left)~ which will take into consideration the origin of ~args.grid~.
** [Standard] Added ~Keyboard#(left|right|up|down)_arrow~ which excludes WASD keys.
** [Standard] Log statements added when a controller is connected.
** [OSS] Synced changes to =api.rb= from open source repo.
* 3.8
** [Pro] [iOS] Fixed issue related to app tombstoning and the simulation loop attempting to catch up when brought back to the foreground.
** [Pro] [iOS] iOS wizard reports CLI errors from ~sh~ commands.
** [Pro] [Android] Better organization of =./.dragonruby/stubs/android/= template files.
** [Support] 3Dconnexion SpaceNavigator device ignored as a controller.
** [OSS] [Support] PR merged: ~Enumerable#sum~ .
** [OSS] [Support] PR merged: Bug fix in reporting test failures accurately .
** [OSS] [Support] PR merged: ~Tweetcart::scene!~ now accepts ~w~ and ~h~ as optional parameters.
** [OSS] [Support] PR merged: ~Tweetcart::tc~ alias to ~$args.state.tick_count~.
** [Support] Performance improvements to rendering.
   1. You should see a 10% to 30% overall increase in rendering performance across all primitives.
   2. You should see a 50% to 200% increase in rendering ~sprites~ represented as ~Hash~.
   3. Game Toolkit's render loop no longer defines/calls ~GTK::Runtime#primitives(pass)~. The rendering pipeline
      handles the enumeration of ~args.outputs~ in C.

      You can define ~GTK::Runtime#primitives(pass)~ if you want to
      override this core rendering behavior. A sample app has been added to demonstrate this:
      =./samples/07_advanced_rendering/15_override_core_rendering=

      It is STRONGLY recommended that you do NOT override core rendering
      behavior unless you know what you're doing.
** [Bugfix] ~Hash#(left|right|top|bottom)~ reports the correct value if any one of those properties is assigned a value.
* 3.7
** [Pro] [Android] Added support for Google Play App Bundles.
** [Pro] [Android] SDK compilation target updated to API 30.
** [Support] ~args.outputs.sprites~ will render the ~:pixel~ render target if ~path~ is not provided.
   Example:
   #+begin_src ruby
     def tick args
       # renders a sprite
       args.outputs.sprites << { x: 0, y: 0, w: 100, h: 100, path: "sprites/square/blue.png" }

       # renders a checker-box
       args.outputs.sprites << { x: 100, y: 100, w: 100, h: 100, path: "sprites/square/does-not-exist.png" }

       # renders a white square
       args.outputs.sprites << { x: 200, y: 200, w: 100, h: 100 }

       # equivalent to
       args.outputs.sprites << { x: 200, y: 200, w: 100, h: 100, path: :pixel }

       # renders a green square

    You can watch the demo video at: [[DragonRuby VR][https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_s_kyOUgzM&ab_channel=RyanC.Gordon]]

    DragonRuby Game Toolkit Pro license holders now have access to DragonRuby Game Toolkit - VR. Go to http://dragonruby.org to
    download. The price of the Pro license has been increased to $128 per year. Anyone who currently has a Pro subscription will be
    grand-fathered in with their current subscription price and will *NOT* see a price increase *EVER*.
*** Indie Subscription Tier
    With the addition of VR capabilities to the Pro tier. A new Indie tier has been
    created (which is cheaper than a Pro license). Here is the breakdown of
    features between each Tier:

*** Sample Apps
    Quite a few sample apps have been added which cover Mario style
    platforming, Oculus Quest VR samples, 3D math concepts, advanced logging concepts, and
    rendering labels inside of ~render_targets~.

** [MAJOR] This is a major release of DragonRuby Game Toolkit
   This is a major release of DragonRuby Game Toolkit. It supports Ruby 3.0 language features
   and contains apis that are anywhere from 30% to 200% faster.

   Even though there are breaking changes, the exceptions that may occur
   should be fairly straightforward to fix. If you need help, come to the DragonRuby
   Discord Server: http://discord.dragonruby.org and we'll help you upgrade.
** [Samples]
*** New 3D sample app has been added that shows how to perform ~Matrix~ transforms.
    Location: =./samples/99_genre_3d/03_yaw_pitch_roll=.
*** New Performance based sample app has been added that shows how to use ~Struct~.
    Location: =./samples/09_performance/01_sprites_as_struct=.
*** New ~render_target~ sample app has been added that shows how to rotate a label using a ~render_target~.
    Location: =./samples/07_advanced_rendering/00_rotating_label=
*** New Topdown RPG sample app has been added that replicates the casino room in Legend of Zelda.
    Location: =./samples/99_genre_rpg_topdown/topdown_casino=
*** New Platforming sample app has been added that breaks down jumping mechanics like in Super Mario Bros.
    Location: =./samples/99_genre_mario/01_jumping=
*** New Platforming sample app has been added that breaks down collision mechanics like in Super Mario Bros.
    Location: =./samples/99_genre_mario/01_jumping_and_collisions=
*** New Advanced Debugging sample app has been added that shows off DR's new logging capabilities.
    Location: =./samples/10_advanced_debugging/00_logging/app/main.rb=
** [Support]
*** [Pro] Embedded http server now supports IPv6.
*** [Pro] Ruby array C Extension generation.
*** [Performance] ~Hash~ value assignment is 16x faster. Rendering using ~Hashes~ is 10x faster.
    This deficiency exists in mRuby and has been optimized in DragonRuby.

    Because of this change, the following code is 16x faster:
    #+begin_src ruby
      some_hash = {}
      some_hash[:a] ||= :some_value
    #+end_src

    In the event of a missing key, the execution speed is also 16x faster:
    #+begin_src ruby
      some_hash = { a: 10 }
      some_hash[:b] # nil, 16x faster
      some_hash[:a] # no speed change/already fast
    #+end_src
*** Labels can support larger font sizes.
*** Structs can be used with ~args.outputs~.
*** ~gtk.benchmark~ is a bit more accurate.
*** Added ~gtk.docs_benchmark~.
*** Moved =./exceptions= and  =./console_history.txt= under =./logs=.
*** Rendering performance improved for ~OpenEntity~.
*** New logging apis have been added.
*** Added ~args.gtk.version_indie?~ for the new Indie tier.
** [Bugfix]
*** Labels no longer shift vertically when the screen is resized.
*** ~args.inputs.mouse.wheel~ reports the correct direction on non Mac machines.
*** ~dragonruby-httpd~ works with Chrome.
*** Crashes related to unsupported Korean keyboard events on MacOS have been resolved. Thank you podo@discord for troubleshooting.
*** Fixed malformed http content for ~args.gtk.http_post_body~.
*** Crashes related to headless unit tests have been fixed.
** [MAJOR]
*** [SAFE] Ruby 3.0 language features are now available. The new syntax should be compatible with Ruby 2.0.
*** [SAFE] Except to see anywhere from 20% to 200% boost in performance overall.
*** [SAFE] [DIVERGENT] DragonRuby's Runtime returns a ~Float~ for integer division (retaining mRuby 2.x behavior).
    In mRuby 3.0, ~1/2~ would return ~0 (Int)~. In the DragonRuby Runtime, ~1/2~ returns ~0.5 (Float)~. Use ~Numeric#idiv~ for
    integer division.
*** [SAFE] [DIVERGENT] DragonRuby's Runtime retained ~rand~ generation algorithms from mRuby 2.0.
    Incorporating 3.0's RNG algorithm would have resulted in unnecessary breaking changes that would have invalidated replays
    of existing games.
*** [SAFE] [DIVERGENT] ~Hash~ in most cases will not discriminate between ~Float~ and ~Int~ keys (where the number after the decimal point is ~0~).
    This was existing mRuby 2.0 behavior and was retained within this major release to avoid unnecessary breaking changes related to key lookup.
*** [BREAKING] Mutation of a ~frozen~ instance with ~include~ or ~extend~ throws an exception (in mRuby 2.0 this behavior did not occur).
    Helpful error messages have been added where this type of mutation is most likely to happen.
*** [BREAKING] Arithmetic and comparison operations no longer attempt to coerce/infer types.
    You will receive exceptions because of this. General troubleshooting tips for these exceptions:
    1. Carefully read the ~backtrace~ for ~Exceptions~ that are thrown (come to our Discord if you need help).
    2. Make sure all references to ~args.state~ have been initialized to a default value.
    3. Audit ~Int/Float~ operations to make sure they are operating on variables
       that have been initialized with a default value.
    4. Audit ~String~ operations to make sure they are operating on variables
       that have been initialized with a default value.
    5. Audit ~Enumerable~ operations to make sure they are operating on variables
       that have been initialized to a default value.
    Special thanks to erquint@discord, leviondiscord@discord, and danhealy@discord for continuing to raise
    debugging concerns with respect to arithmetic/implicit coercion.
*** [BREAKING] DragonRuby's "Level 1" Runtime has been updated to mRuby 3.0.
    This is a major release of DragonRuby Game Toolkit. The breaking changes should be minimal, but unfortunately do exist.
    Please report issues in our Discord and we will get them resolved right away: http://discord.dragonruby.org (mention @amirrajan).

    A special thank you to podo@discord, hiro_r_b@discord, kfischer_okarin@discord, and leviondiscord@discord for troubleshooting.

    A full explanation of DragonRuby's Multilevel Runtime Architecture can be found here: http://docs.dragonruby.org/#----what-is-dragonruby-
    Please read through it so you have a better understanding of how DragonRuby is different than other Ruby runtimes.
    It's VERY IMPORTANT to educate yourself on these differentiators. Especially if you find yourself being asked:
    #+begin_quote
      Why are you using Ruby to build games? Ruby is slow.
    #+end_quote
*** [SOFT BREAK] In a small subset of situations (such as with frozen objects), ~Hash~ keys *will* differentiate between ~Float~ and ~Int~ keys.
    This is new behavior in mRuby 3.0, so be cognizant of this subtlety if you receive an exception.
    The following works in mRuby 2.0:
    #+begin_src ruby
      def tick args
        sample_hash = { 3.0 => "float value resolved", 4 => "int value resolved" }
        puts sample_hash[3.0] # float value resolved
        puts sample_hash[3]   # float value resolved

        puts sample_hash[4.0] # int value resolved
        puts sample_hash[4]   # int value resolved
      end
    #+end_src
    But in some instances, it may not work in 3.0:
    #+begin_src ruby
      def tick args
        sample_hash = { 3.0 => "float value resolved", 4 => "int value resolved" }
        puts sample_hash[3.0] # float value resolved
        puts sample_hash[3]   # might return nil

        puts sample_hash[4.0] # might return nil
        puts sample_hash[4]   # int value resolved
      end
    #+end_src
    If you know ahead of time if your keys are ~Int~s. Be sure to invoke ~.to_i~ on any keys that may have been
    converted into a ~Float~ (especially when deserializing data from disk).
** [Pro] [Bugfix]
